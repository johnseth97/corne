# corne

This is the repository for the firmware that runs my corne keyboard, built with a typereactive kit.

The keyboard has a nice!nano v2 controller on each side, and a nice!view screen on each side as well.

Currently this repo is quite basic as I familiarize myself with the stock firmware, so I can better identify the sore spots that I want to address.
